I've finished everything but the testing phase. For TestTrafficIncidentReportsServiceImpl.java, I have left the dbhost, username, and password strings empty so the grader can fill it in with their credentials. I have also left the DBHOST, DBUSERNAME, DBPASSWORD empty inside web.xml as stated in the instructions. I also receive a 500 internal server error due to conflicting timezones for which I had to add some extra things to my dburl inside TrafficIncidentReportsResource.java.
